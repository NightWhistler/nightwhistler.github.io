As I was figuring out OrgMode (which I hope to write a post about soon) I found out that my owncloud server was getting seriously long in the tooth.

In fact, it was lagging so far behind that the latest owncloud app for android refused to connect to it

Since I had some time on my hands around the holidays I figured I'd upgrade it, which also included upgrading my home Debian server to Debian 9, since I was still running Debian 8.

A word of advice: If you have not yet started upgrading your owncloud server, do yourself a favour and make sure to upgrade to owncloud 9.1 _first_, before even thinking of upgrading to Debian 9!
You will save yourself a lot of pain and work.

If however, you did what I did and first upgraded to Debian 9 only to find out that owncloud refuses to upgrade over multiple major versions: read on.
