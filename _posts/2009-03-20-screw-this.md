Thatâ€™s pretty much how I felt yesterdayâ€¦ had been at work for 2 hours, and it was clear: I wasnâ€™t going to be productive that dayâ€¦

Steve McConnel has a nice quote about days like that in Code Complete (a must-read)â€¦ donâ€™t remember the exact words, but it comes down to that if you know youâ€™re having a crappy day and you persist in writing code anyway, youâ€™ll spend the rest of the week fixing the code you wrote that dayâ€¦

So, I decided that it wouldnâ€™t be fair to the client to have them pay my hourly rate just so I could browse the web and it wasnâ€™t fair to me to keep my ass at a desk when Iâ€™d much rather be outside ðŸ˜ƒ

So, I took the rest of the day off: best idea Iâ€™ve had all week.

Had some lunch, browsed a bookstore, had a walk in the sunâ€¦ then went home and read 100 pages of Cryptonomicon. I got back at my desk this morning feeling refreshedâ€¦. Thanks Steve!
