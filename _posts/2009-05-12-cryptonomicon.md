I finally finished reading Cryptonomicon yesterday… this book holds a second place after “The Stand” for book that took me the longest to finish… I started reading it over a year ago, put it away, came back and finally finished it… since I was requested to blog that kind of stuff too, here goes… 😉

First of all: this book’s strength was for me also it’s biggest weakness… it’s realistic to a fault. Let me clarify that: I’ve never read a book that got Linux/Unix related things right to such a level of detail. It was very nice to see an author know his stuff to this degree, but it also brought on a reaction of “I deal with this stuff every day… why would I want to read about a character doing the same?”

Once I got a bit more into it, I realized that the depth in which cryptography is explored was actually pretty amazing at the time it was written. These days encrypting your hard-drive under Linux means checking a box during the installation procedure, but Cryptonomicon pretty much predicted it.

One of the story-lines is about a couple of guys trying to build something called “The Crypt”, which would offer heavily encrypted storage space to anyone willing to pay. This made me think about both the technical feasability of such a project (not so hard anymore), and the legal consequences (huge). It also made me wonder how many geeks before me had tried to actually build a Crypt 😃

For now work and life don’t quite allow such a hobby project, but I must admit… it’s tempting. I wouldn’t actually try to host it though… I prefer my house nice and unraided 😅
