My Wii had been gathering more and more dust, since I spend most of my gaming time (which isn‚Äôt much to begin with) on the XBox360‚Ä¶ but no more :) I picked up House of the Dead Overkill for the Wii and learned how shooting zombies with your wife can be a truly binding experience‚Ä¶

As some of you might know, I‚Äôm just a sucker for bad horror movies‚Ä¶ the whole zombie theme here might have been a hint :p House of the Dead overkill didn‚Äôt look like much when I looked at the box, but the huge white plastic gun it comes with convinced me to buy it anyway‚Ä¶ and it turns out this game was made by people that love bad movies as much as I do.

The opening features a stripper showing off her (not too impressive) skills on a pole, while trying to act sexy with a wii-mote‚Ä¶ just hilarious‚Ä¶ which reminds me to write a review of Zombie Strippers, but I‚Äôll save that for next time. Anyway, the B-movie tone is properly set and just keeps on getting better‚Ä¶. the story is completely ridiculous, as is to be expected of a B-movie of this kind, the gore is over the top‚Ä¶ really, there‚Äôs just one staple of B-movies missing: boobies :) I guess that was a bit too much for Nintendo‚Ä¶ maybe in the next one‚Ä¶ we can only hope.

For now I‚Äôve also picked up the House of the Dead II and III pack, mostly for the extra gun provided with it‚Ä¶ and been enjoying some good, dirty family fun splattering zombie brains all over the walls together with the mrs‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll get her into zombie movies yet :)
