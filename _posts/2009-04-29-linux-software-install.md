OK, this is something that has irked me for a while now… common misconceptions about installing software on linux.

I keep hearing about ‘having to compile everything yourself’ and ‘I don’t have the programs I need’. The second one may be true if you think that Powerpoint is the only way to give a presentation and iTunes the only way to listen to music. The first point hasn’t been true for years though… On today’s menu: a minor rant 😃

I recently stumbled this blog post:

It’s not about Linux at all, but as so often happens, a discussion unfolded in the comments about Linux software installation. This comment in particular caught my eye:

> Linux guys you do realize that 99% of all users want to never have to compile anything… right? Windows users want to run a install file and be done with it.
>
> That is not something that you can do with Linux. Every program I install I have to go find its library’s and recompile something. Its a royal pain in the rear.  
>
> Once the aps I use in windows, not some lame knock off and the games I use in windows works in Unix without needing to spend 30min to get each one working…. then come back and talk to us. Better yet dont. Most of us use Linux already for work and guess what we like windows better.

I have seen this misconception repeated a lot of times, and yes: it was once true. Actually, for some distributions like Slackware of Gentoo it is still true. But.. neither of those aim at casual users as an audience.

On most modern distributions like Debian or Ubuntu, installing software is actually a lot easier than on Windows. Now, that’s quite a bold statement to make… but allow me to illustrate:

Say, I’m looking for a program to manage my personal finances. Both on Windows and on Linux I probably wouldn’t have a program to do this in my head off the bat. So, how do I go about getting one?

On Windows, I’d probably start in Google. A quick websearch leads me to a number of pages which offer programs for sale. If I look hard enough, I’ll probably find some free ones as well.

For the free ones, the next step is simple. I go to their site, find a download for the program, save it to my hard-disk and run the installer. I click “OK” a few times, accept the licence, and I’m in business. Should I not like the program, I can find the uninstaller, click “OK” a few times again and remove it from my machine again. Then, I go find the next program and the cycle continues.

All this is the best case scenario however. It assumes that my free program didn’t contain any spyware and that it was free to begin with. For non-free alternatives (“free” as in beer), I’d either have to pirate it which means browsing for cracks and such, or go out and buy it in a store, or buy it online with my credit card. After this point the same story applies as for the free alternative.

You might wonder what I’m getting at here… I mean, come on… none of this sounds all that hard, right? That’s true, because it’s what you’re used to when working with Windows. But now, let me illustrate the same procedure on Linux:

I’m still looking for a program to do my personal finances… I go to my menu, select System->Package Manager.

At this point I get asked for my administrative password… I enter it, and I’m presented with a list of software. I click, “Search”, enter “finance program” and click “OK”. I’m now presented with a list of programs which allow me to manage my finances… I select the programs which seem interesting, click “Install”, and that’s it.

The software is installed, it shows up in my menus and it’s ready to use…. no compiling, no Google, no hassle. You don’t need a mental catalogue of which software to use for which task, it’s all provided. And trying different alternatives is easy too… just install what looks good, try it and if you don’t like it uninstalling is just as easy.

In my opinion, just having 1 place you go to whenever you need software is a lot more convenient than having to hunt around the web for it… and also, you can always be sure that any software you install will be spyware and virus-free…

Oh, and as to gaming: the list includes quite a few games too… or do what I did and get an XBox 😃
